# pxt-song

A package for playing songs on the micro:bit.

## Improvements

Here's a list of things that could be done to make this package better.

- Split apart the config for the song into separate blocks to make things simpler to use (and alterable)
- Play long songs by chaining song blocks together (without stutter?)
- Extend the ABC notation (wider range of notes maybe?)
- Add different notations? (Not restricted to just ABC?)
- Play multiple tones together? Is this possible?
