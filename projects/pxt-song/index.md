## pxt-song

A package for playing songs on the micro:bit.

- [Use](https://pxt.microbit.org/33843-00731-68091-88885) (in the pxt online editor)
- [Download](/projects/pxt-song/custom.ts) (the package's `custom.ts` file)

Here's an example of the package in action. Press the A button to hear "Mary had a Little Lamb" played in the dulcet tones of the micro:bit's simulator.

### Diary

This package was built by the wonderful [fozzzyyy](https://github.com/fozzzyyy) and [AnantKapoor](https://github.com/AnantKapoor) during the November 2016 [Villiers Park](http://www.villierspark.org.uk/) Computer Science Residential.

This package pre-dates this website, so unfortunately, fozzzyyy and AnantKapoor didn't get the oppourtunity to write any diary entries for this package.

This is a wonderfully complex package that makes it so easy to play entire songs on the micro:bit, especially when compared to the exisiting Music package's "play tone" function.

Note: Since this package was made, it looks like the "start melody" function was added to the Music package. It's not quite as good as ours :)
