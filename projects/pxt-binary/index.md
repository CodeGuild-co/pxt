## pxt-binary

A package of useful utilities for dealing with binary numbers.

- [Use](https://pxt.microbit.org/46877-08663-07883-62991) (in the pxt online editor)
- [Download](/projects/pxt-binary/custom.ts) (the package's `custom.ts` file)

Here's an example of using the package to display a large number (14156151) on the screen in binary.

<div style="position:relative;height:0;padding-bottom:81.97%;overflow:hidden;"><iframe style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" src="https://pxt.microbit.org/---run?id=46877-08663-07883-62991" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" sandbox="allow-popups allow-scripts allow-same-origin" frameborder="0"></iframe></div>


### Diary

This package was built by the wonderful [JosephBarker123](https://github.com/JosephBarker123) during the November 2016 [Villiers Park](http://www.villierspark.org.uk/) Computer Science Residential.

This package pre-dates this website, so unfortunately, JosephBarker123 didn't get the oppourtunity to write any diary entries for this package.

This is a cool package that solves the problem of having so little space on the micro:bit to display numbers. Instead of having to scroll large numbers, very slowly, you can instead use a binary representation of the number where each LED light is on or off for that power of 2. It makes more sense when you start to use it.
