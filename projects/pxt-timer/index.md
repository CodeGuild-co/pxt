## pxt-timer

A package for using timers. For instance a countdown timer, that waits for X seconds, then executes the contained block(s).

- [Use](https://pxt.microbit.org/27894-12248-50597-41039) (in the pxt online editor)
- [Download](/projects/pxt-timer/custom.ts) (the package's `custom.ts` file)

Here's an example of the timer in action. Running a countdown for 10 seconds, then showing the message "Done!".

### Diary

This package was built by the wonderful [CharlotteKell](https://github.com/CharlotteKell) during the November 2016 [Villiers Park](http://www.villierspark.org.uk/) Computer Science Residential.

This package pre-dates this website, so unfortunately, CharlotteKell didn't get the opportunity to write any diary entries for this package.

It was tricky learning how to get the package to accept nested blocks. We wanted to be able to countdown and then execute any arbitrary blocks that were dragged inside the timer. After a bit of fiddling, we got there!
