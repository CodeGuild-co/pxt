# pxt-timer

A package for using timers. For instance a countdown timer, that waits for X seconds, then executes the contained block(s).


## Improvements

Here's a list of things that could be done to make this package better.

- A timer that doesn't show stuff on the screen (e.g. invisible timers)
- A block that times how long its contents take to run
- A block that repeats its contents every X seconds
