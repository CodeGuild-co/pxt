## Welcome!

Members of the CodeGuild have been hard at work, creating new, complex, and exciting packages for the BBC micro:bit. This website documents their work.

You'll find links and descriptions for all of the packages that the CodeGuild have created. As well as blog posts on how it was all acheived.

If you'd like to jump right in and start <strong>using the packages</strong> visit the [list page](/list/) and follow the instructions.

If you'd like to <strong>browse the code</strong> and see what's what, you'll find everything in our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/CodeGuild-co/pxt-packages/tree/master/projects).

If you'd like to <strong>download the code</strong> then you can grab the latest release on the left-hand side of the page. Or download each package individually from its page.
